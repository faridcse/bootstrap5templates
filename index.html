    <h2>Explains Viewport</h2>
    <p>Since new devices have radically different screen sizes, the viewport has become a major consideration in responsive design. Engineers have to figure out how to fit webpages into a small viewport for a traditional smartphone or mobile device. Even tablets tend to be smaller than traditional computer screens.<br>

    Designers can use a viewport meta tag in HTML and a tool in Cascading Style Sheets to set viewport parameters such as height and width as well as viewport scale and resolution.<br>

    Using the viewport meta tag is an important part of matching page compatibility to a device screen. Typically, designers look at all of the text, images and functionality in a page and lay it out according to what the viewport can handle â€“ and when they put in viewport limitations, this provides a technical set of parameters to work from.</p>

    <h2>Setting The Viewport</h2>
    <p>HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the &lt;meta&gt; tag.<br>

    You should include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages:<br>

    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;<br>
    This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.<br>

    The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).<br>

    The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.</p>

    <h2>Size Content to The Viewport</h2>
    <p>Users are used to scroll websites vertically on both desktop and mobile devices - but not horizontally!<br>

    So, if the user is forced to scroll horizontally, or zoom out, to see the whole web page it results in a poor user experience.<br>

    Some additional rules to follow:<br>

    1. Do NOT use large fixed width elements - For example, if an image is displayed at a width wider than the viewport it can cause the viewport to scroll horizontally. Remember to adjust this content to fit within the width of the viewport.<br>

    2. Do NOT let the content rely on a particular viewport width to render well - Since screen dimensions and width in CSS pixels vary widely between devices, content should not rely on a particular viewport width to render well.<br>

    3. Use CSS media queries to apply different styling for small and large screens - Setting large absolute CSS widths for page elements will cause the element to be too wide for the viewport on a smaller device. Instead, consider using relative width values, such as width: 100%. Also, be careful of using large absolute positioning values. It may cause the element to fall outside the viewport on small devices.</p>
